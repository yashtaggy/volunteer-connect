# Environment variables (if you have them, often in src/main/resources/application.properties)
# If your application.properties contains sensitive data you don't want on GitHub,
# you might want to exclude it or use environment variables/external config.
# For now, if it's just database connection strings for local, it's often included.
# If you had application-dev.properties, application-prod.properties, you might exclude prod ones.
# For now, let's assume application.properties is fine to include.
